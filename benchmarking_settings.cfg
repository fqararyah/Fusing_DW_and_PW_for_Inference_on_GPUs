Clarifications:

These settings are used bu CNN_segment.cpp to run a segment of a CNN:
There already existing CNNs are:
Xception, MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, ProxylessNAS.

FIRST_LAYER: 
The first layer of the CNN segment.

NUM_LAYERS: 
The number of conv layers in the CNN segment.
Max valid NUM_LAYERS in the models starting from the first conv layer:
max valid NUM_LAYERS xce_r 73
max valid NUM_LAYERS mob_v1 26
max valid NUM_LAYERS mob_v2 51
max valid NUM_LAYERS prox_g 43

FUSION_FILE: 
The file containing the layers to be fused (see int8_fusion_configs/*)

IFMS_FILE:
The file containing the input of the FIRST_LAYER

DUMP_FILE:
The file to write the output of the last layer to (in case correctness is to be validated)

TEST_ITERATIONS:
The number of iterations whose average is reported

RUN_FUSED:
If set to zero, the FUSION_FILE is ignored and only the LBL is run

NUM_SMS:
The number of the targeted GPU Streaming Multiprocessors

BENCH:
0 means read images from disk, do inference ...
1 means uses one image and runs multiple inferences, but there is memory copy before each inference
>= 2 means no cuda memory copy (the data is dummy and is not updated each iteration)
